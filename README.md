# Online-TIK-TAK-TOE-JAVA

Originally made in June, 2019

A personal project made in java that allowed two people to connect and play tik-tak-toe from anywhere. This was done by a server connection but in a very atypical way. When I created this application I knew nothing about sockets and that form of connection. What I did know was SQL and a JDBC driver that could allow connection to it. So that is what I used to read and process user-input as well as game mechanics. A very wrong way of doing it, I know.
